**This repository contains a Python script for predicting flight ticket prices using a machine learning regression model.**



**The program loads flight data from a CSV file and preprocesses it by applying one-hot encoding to categorical features such as airline, source city, destination city, departure time, arrival time, number of stops, and travel class. Numerical features including flight duration and days left before departure are combined with the encoded data to form the input dataset.**



**The dataset is split into training and testing sets. A Random Forest Regressor is trained on the training data, and the model’s score on the test data is printed. The trained model is then used to predict flight prices for the test dataset.**
